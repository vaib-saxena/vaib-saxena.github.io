To design a closed loop system for self assembly and disassembly of a tangible product.
This loop to is specifically a closed one at this point of time to limit the scope but on a larger scale if things start interacting, then an open loop is formed. 


To facilitate and encourage greater rates of reuse and recycling in the future. 
Circular cycle. 
product design and many cars and computers are now designed for disassembly to allow for future component and material recovery.

This is all about digital materials and building with logic. We currently use analog materials. Manual assembly, robotic assembly and self assembly. Fighting assembly time. A lot of mistakes happen and the amount of information is only stored in the assembler.

1. Each unit must have at least 2 states
2. The activated structure must have defined boundaries (beginning & end) -Preventing them from attaching to the wrong units -non-aperiodic
3. Kinetic energy must be captured and transferred to potential energy
4. Each activated unit must be capable of communicating its state to another unit with which it isin close contact
5. Must ensure eventual unit contact & latching.
