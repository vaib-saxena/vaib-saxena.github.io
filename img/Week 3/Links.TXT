topology optimisation is a
mathematical approach that optimises material layout
within a given design space, for a given set of
loads and boundary conditions, such that the resulting
layout meets a prescribed set of performance targets.
The solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method has been widely employed in topology optimizations for its
effectiveness and low computational cost.

The conjugate gradient method is a mathematical technique that can be useful for the optimization of both linear and non-linear systems. This technique is generally used as an iterative algorithm, however, it can be used as a direct method, and it will produce a numerical solution. Generally this method is used for very large systems where it is not practical to solve with a direct method.  It is helpful in minimization. The precussor for this is "gradient descent" method.  
In mathematics, a system of linear equations (or linear system) is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same set of variables.[1] For example,

    3 x + 2 y - z = 1 2 x - 2 y + 4 z = - 2 - x + 1 2 y - z = 0 

is a system of three equations in the three variables x, y, z. A solution to a linear system is an assignment of values to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied.
On the other hand a non-linear system, the change on outputs is not proportional to change in inputs.

Another thing is tuples are immutable i.e. you cannot change them.
a = (1,2,3,5) is a tuple
b = [1,2,3,5] is a list 
you can have list within a list
c = [1,2, [1,2], 3]
print(b[3]) #will print 1,2
c.append(20) #will add 20 at the end of the list c and will make it c= [1,2, [1,2], 3, 20]

c= range(100) gives a list starting from 0 to 99 i.e c=[0,1,2,......99]
Another way to do it c = range(start, stop, step), for example c= (10, 99, 2)

for x in range(100) #means that x is a placeholder for range(100) or this could be further written as c = range(100), for x in c:

for x in range(100) runs the code 100 times

for x in range(0,100,5) runs from 0 to 100 but steps in 5
