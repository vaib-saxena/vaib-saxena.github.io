TARGETS THIS WEEK: EDIT GCODE AND METAMATERIALS/AUXETICS

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxetics - it is the same thing that Hasso Platner did on dezeen

metamaterials - a synthetic composite material with a structure such that it exhibits
 properties not usually found in natural materials, especially a negative refractive index.

Optimising prototype timing

weaving - like kagoma weave

Kinematics - INterlocking by nervous system (https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/projects/albums/kinematics-concept/`

CYmatics
pufferfish
interlocking (UCL)
Burning man

There were few things that I wanted to do, use 3d printing to reduce time (since we had only one printer) and 
also move in the direction of metamaterials to achive certain properties like elasticity and shape morphing by 
interlocking and weaving.  Again in this I can have a homogeomous structure of a heterogenous structure.

The focus in not only to shape outer structure but also the inner structure.

Text- THE ONE HOUR 3D Printing CHallenge
I realized that rathen than going for rounded lines its better to go for strips. Also, the print time is much more
than what it is shown while the print is given. https://annietzhang.com/3d-printed-textile.
I took a predefined script but had to change few parameters like that of bed temperature and extruder temperature.
M190 S100 - is used to set the bed temperature
M109 S235 - is used to set the extrusion temperature to 235 before continuing

Debugging to start- flipping the curve.
Setting the temperature like above.
To change the internal pattern for any closed polygon shell, I used various mathematical functions and created a 
whole new different script. To check the consistency of the script, a single polyline would have been created at the end.

In the next iteration, I changed the feed rate to 3000 mm/min and saw that the external boundary wasn't very clean and was 
untidy and on the other hand it was taut as compared to the previous one with one(the circle was sagging)

IN the third iteration, I used demiliter rather than replacing the text, I changed the external web to 1200 mm/min
and internal web to 6000 mm/min and it failed badly. 

Steps to use Autodesk Recap Photo:
1. Use your student account to download Autodesk ReCap 2019.(Do check minimum requirements for your PC)
2. Autodesk Recap Photo has some amazing capabilities and from scanning small objects, it can also scan and 
create 3D files of a terrain using a drone scanner. 
3. This is a very useful tutorial as to how to take photos for photogrammetry. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7Torjkfec4

STl. ile only exports the mesh and doesn't give us the texture.
I later on exported the .obj file as it gave me the options to export the file with textures.

Steps to use Sense 3D scanner(https://www.3dsystems.com/shop/sense):
1. It can be mounted on a tripod, but since we didn't have it, we went for handhelding.
2. The software for Sense 3D scanner could be downloaded from https://www.3dsystems.com/shop/support/sense2/downloads
3. Scan, edit, enhance, share
4.

Precautions and Limitations:
1. Do not scan a shiny, transparent surface or object.
2. It needs a USB wired connection, hence making it immobile.
3.
